FuckItJS
========
### Javascript Error Steamroller

FuckItJS uses state-of-the-art technology to make sure your javascript code runs whether your compiler likes it or not.

Technology
----------

Through a process known as *Eval-Rinse-Reload-And-Repeat*, FuckItJS repeatedly compiles your code, detecting errors and slicing those lines out of the script.
To survive such a violent process, FuckItJS reloads itself after each iteration, allowing the onerror handler to catch every single error in your terribly written code.

Installation
------------

1. Include "fuckit.js"
2. The End

API
---

**FuckIt**(*path_to_your_shitty_script_file*)

This will keep evaluating your code until all errors have been sliced off like mold on a piece of perfectly good bread.
Whether or not the remaining code is even worth executing, we don't know. We also don't particularly care.

FAQ
-------

**1) Is this a good idea?**

Of course not. This is quite possibly the worst javascript plugin ever written.

**2) Isn't "eval" evil?**

See Question #1.
